  I'm passionate about learning new stuff every day, but if something inspires me more than acquiring knowledge, is generating it. I build <mark>Machine Learning</mark> models with the purpose of having a positive “real” impact on any project I am working on. Each situation requires different solutions, my mission is to find the best one.
  I started programming when I was in university, and by now, I have clocked thousands of hours coding. I crave the feeling of solving long and complex problems, nothing is more satisfying than your work having a real purpose that benefits people. 

  Overall, I’m a strong believer in the saying “Put your all in everything you do” and have continued to stand by it. I hope to be part of a team that really cares about making the best product for any situation.

          - Assisted in scientific research on behavioral decision making changes based on induced negative biases, and analyzed the
          results.
          
          - Designed and implemented dozens of machine learning and deep learning models to provide diagnostic analytics to
          medical professionals.
          
          - Analyzed datasets and created dashboards to communicate insights and to assist with data driven decision-making.

          -  Built the architecture of an SQL database and implemented a data pipeline to retrieve and store data from a Unity based
             project, saving an approximate of 30 hours of monthly labor.

          
          - Performed EDA and created dashboards for project proposals and addressing business problems.
          
          - Designed and implemented multiple machine learning models for structured and semi-structured data to perform both
            descriptive and predictive analytics.
